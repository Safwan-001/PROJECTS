Hello ! This repository branch is all about the projects i have worked with. Here till now, i have worked on-

# ATM INTERFACE : 
This is a simple ATM interface where you won't find any guis. Data storage is available but not in a practical manner, basically this project is just a demo and it needs retouches to be at a peak stage. Still you can perform tasks like the basic ATM does. THANK YOU !
brief demonstration- this interface comprises of two files. The CARDHOLDER.py imports the module ATM.py, only to be at full functionality, there's no GUI i repeat. So the project will be improved as time passes...
# CALCULATOR (TKINTER) :
A very enjoyable project that i have worked on under the mentorship and currently improving this by myself, it's a working calculator with a GUI TKINTER used in it. You can perform all the basic calculations throrough this calculator and utilize the program. This code obviously eeds an IDE like the ATM project does. Thank YOU! :D
